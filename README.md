# About
This is a simple paint app made using OpenGL and C++. OpenGL was required from the assigment specifications, and I wanted to study a bit more of C++ and it's intricacies

## How to run it?
install dependencies:

``

    sudo apt-get install freeglut3 freeglut3-dev libglew-dev
    sudo apt-get install mesa-utils
    
``

then, in the project folder, just run:

``
make && ./noteapp
``

This rudimentary paint app can:

- paint using left mouse button;
- open a small menu with right click;
- change between 3 colors;
- change between 3 line widths;
- Enter Erase mode by pressing the 'E' key;
- Delete everything on screen by pressing the 'D' key.
